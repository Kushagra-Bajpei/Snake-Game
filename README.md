Nokia Snake Classic 🐍

This project is a recreation of the legendary Nokia Snake Game — one of my favorite childhood memories.
I decided to code it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a fun side project to bring back the nostalgia.

✨ Features:

Classic snake movement (just like old Nokia phones)

Works on desktop (keyboard controls) and mobile (touch controls)

Lightweight, simple, and fun to play anytime

🔗 Feel free to clone, fork, or just play and enjoy!
